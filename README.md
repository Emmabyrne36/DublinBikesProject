# DublinBikesProject
Dublin Bikes Project Utilising Flask, JavaScript, Python and Web Services.

A Dublin Bikes web application was developed as part of a college group project.
This project involved the following skills:

    * Creating and maintaining an Amazon EC2 instance
    * Developing a Flask-based web application which would allow a user to access all of the bike stations in Dublin, belonging to Dublin bikes and view the availability of bikes at those stops in real time.
    * Creating a Python-based web scraper to parse JSON data obtained from the Dublin Bikes API to obtain the availability information.
    * This data was stored in an Amazon RDS MySQL instance and accessed by the web application.
    * Using Dublin Bikes and OpenWeatherMap APIs.
    * Group work, SCRUM Agile methodology for software development.
